# Virtual Ecology Workbench (VEW)
## Latest version: 3.4.775

This is a Java-based toolkit for creating individual/agent-based models of the plankton ecosystem from
phenotypic equations, using the Lagrangian Ensemble Integration method. It includes a somewhat rudimentary
equation editing system, resulting in an XML file with equations stored in a latex-like way. These are then
code-generated into Java classes for interactive or non-interactive simulations.

The code is most of 20 years old now, dating to my Ph.D (a collaboration between Imperial Department of Computing
and Earth Sciences), but I still occasionally receive support requests and projects still arise for its ongoing 
development. So, here it is, still in usable form in Java, although there is ample room for code improvements.

## Usage

* You need a JDK installed, with javac in your path.
* Also you need to copy `tools.jar` from the lib folder of Java, into the `VEW` folder.
* See `c.bat` or `c.sh` to compile the VEW.
* See `vew.bat` or `vew.sh` to run the VEW.

## Input Data

* Yes... I haven't worked out how to make several gigabytes of input data available. Get in touch...

## Documentation

To be updated when I have more time. (Post-covid).

## Relevant Papers
